## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082), evoking professionalism and creativity, reflecting the expertise in animation, VFX, and design.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated blue (#121723). It harmonizes with the primary, reinforcing a professional appearance, while remaining subdued.
- Accent color: Light purple (#A020F0). Used to highlight interactive elements and call-to-actions, this vivid tone emphasizes parts of the website while remaining true to the theme.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif font that conveys a precise, fashionable look.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif to balance the geometric headlines with a more readable and modern style. 
- Use a set of consistent, modern icons for skills and social media links. Icons should be simple, geometric, and filled.
- Apply GSAP scroll reveals (fade/slide), parallax effects for the hero section, smooth transitions for tabs, card hover effects (lift + shadow bloom + zoom), and animated pills for filters. Persist Dark/Light & EN/AR toggles with localStorage.
